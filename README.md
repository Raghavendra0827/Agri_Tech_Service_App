# Movie Recommendation App

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App project repository! ðŸŽ¬

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a Movie Recommendation App that recommends movies based on the genre of a selected movie. Leveraging Python and Streamlit, this app provides an interactive interface for users to input movie IDs and view recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Genre-Based Recommendations**: Utilize the genre information of movies to recommend similar movies to the user.
- **Interactive Interface**: Implement a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for inputting movie IDs and displaying recommendations.
- **Background Image**: Enhance the visual appeal of the app with a background image.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the movie dataset to ensure accurate recommendations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Raghavendra0827/Netfilx_Movie_Recommendation.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the App**: Execute the Streamlit web application by running `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. **Input Movie ID**: Enter a movie ID in the provided input field.
5. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Submit" button to get recommendations based on the selected movie's genre.
6. **Explore Recommendations**: View the recommended movies displayed in the app interface and discover new movies to watch!
